AS USER:
-- I can see a featured map of a specific neighborhood as soon as I load the page
-- I can see 5 or more highlighted locations markers on the featured map
-- I can also see those locations on a list
-- I can see everything I need in a single page (single-page app)
-- I can filter the locations through an input field OR a dropdown menu.
-- I see filtered locations' list items and markers on map update dynamically according to applied filter.
- I can see an animation (bounce, color-change, etc) on the correspondent marker when I click on a marker or a list item.
- I can access the app from a desktop, tablet or mobile and see it nice in all devices.
- I can see an adequate notification when something fails (ex.: google or any other third-party API doesn't load)
- I can click on a marker OR a list-item to see info from a third-party API (flickr imgs, yelp, wikipedia, etc. -Not from Google libraries-) in an infoWindow


AS APP:
- I call the Google Maps API only once, to add a full-screen map to my page.
- I use KO to handle info on page subject to change (such as filter and list), to track click events on list items
- I handle things done by Maps API with the API and not KO (ex.: creating markers -they should not be KO observables-, tracking click events on them, making/refreshing the map) 
- I load all data APIs asynchronously



Indicate on UI AND README what interfaces you are using.

Data is loaded from an external source (personal challenge - alternative: LocalStorage)
DOM is not updated manually but via KO.

A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.

Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures.
